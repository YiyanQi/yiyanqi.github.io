# ðŸ“Ž About Me

I work at International Digital Economy Academy <img src='./images/IDEA.png' style='width: 5em;'> as a research scientist now in Shenzhen, China. 
Prior to joining IDEA, I worked at Tencent as a Senior Researcher.
I hold a Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering, and a B.S. degree in Automation Science and Technology, both from Xi'an Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Prof. Pinghui Wang. 

I am now working on MLLM, graph learning, and time series analysis. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [qiyiyan@idea.edu.cn](mailto:qiyiyan@idea.edu.cn). We are hiring interns!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
